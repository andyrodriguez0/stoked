                <h2>Our Mission:</h2>

                <div id="our-mission-text">

                    <p>Over 34 million people in the United States, including 9 million children, are unable to access nutritious food on a regular basis,
                        making them food insecure. Stoked is on a mission to directly combat hunger in these communities through its network of
                        affordable, healthy, and convenient food trucks.</p>

                    <p>We believe that financial hardship is just one the obstacles that individuals must overcome to sustain a healthy diet.
                        The growing prevalence of food deserts across the country have left communities with fewer options for groceries and fresh produce every year.
                        The result is a reliance on unhealthy but cheap fast food, the long-term effects of which include chronic diseases such as diabetes, high cholesterol, 
                        and high blood pressure, and disproprtionately affect these communities, .</p>

                    <p>That's where Stoked comes in. Stoked is a network of food trucks that partially operate in food insecure 
                        neighborhoods, selling food on a donation-priced basis. The remainder of the time is spent selling meals 
                        at market price in other neighborhoods. We partner with entrepreneurial community members to cater flavors and 
                        options to best serve our communities.</p>

                    <p>We are a collection of individuals that believe healthy food is foundational to living a fulfilling life and are passionate about helping
                        others achieve self-fulfillment. We believe too many individuals lack access to the activities and relationships that bring them fulfillment
                        because they are constantly worrying about where their next meal will come from and what it will look like.</p>

                    <p>Stoked was founded by Dheeraj Bandaru, Sanjeeth Rajaram, and Katie O’Brien. Dheeraj first started working 
                        on the idea behind Stoked when he worked for the City Planning Division in the City of Atlanta on food
                        sustainability business model plans. The team spent months researching the food value chain and ideating 
                        a solution to the City of Atlanta’s surplus of gleaned crops, and eventually came up with idea of food trucks.</p>

                    <p>Since then, the Stoked team has grown to include a collection of individuals with a wealth of experience 
                        across food-related endeavors, community organization, branding, and business. It has found a community and developed relationships within the
                        city of Chicago, which serves as its homebase.</p>
                    
                    <p>Stoked was recently accepted for Phase II of the <a href="https://polsky.uchicago.edu/programs-events/new-venture-challenge/social-new-venture-challenge/">
                        Social New Venture Challenge</a>, a social entrepreneurship program at the University of Chicago.</p>
