        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        <p>Stoked is on a mission to combat hunger in communities across the country through affordable, healthy, and convenient food trucks.</p>
        <p>We believe that hunger is not just a result of financial hardship, but also limited access to affordable and nutritious food. The growing prevalence of food deserts leaves communities with decreasingly fewer options every year.</p>
        <p>That's where Stoked comes in. We partner with community members to bring "pay-what-you-wish" food trucks to communities and serve healthy and dignified meals.</p>
