            <p>Stoked is on a mission to combat hunger in communities across the country with its network of
                 affordable, healthy, and convenient food trucks. Over 34 million people in the United States, 
                 including 9 million children, are unable to access nutritious food on a regular basis,
                 making them food insecure.</p>
            <p>We believe that financial hardship is just part of the obstacle that individuals must overcome to gain access.
                The growing prevalence of food deserts have left communities with fewer options every year and has created
                a reliance on unhealthy but cheap fast food. The long-term effects of this are seen in the chronic diseases
            that affect these communities, including hiabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.</p>
            <p>That's where Stoked comes in. Stoked is a network of food trucks that partially operate in food insecure 
                neighborhoods, selling food on a donation-priced basis. The remainder of the time is spent selling meals 
                at market price in other neighborhoods. We partner with entrepreneurial community members to cater flavors and 
                options to best serve our communities.</p>
